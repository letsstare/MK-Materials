### Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?  
Growing up I had minimal exposure to technology other than word processing tools. 

Growing up I had minimal exposure to technology. We had a computer and TV but our access was restricted and my parents did not allow any video or computer games in the house. Because of this I was *constantly* reading and I was obsessed with learning anything about history. My interests made me think that academia would be the best fit for me: I wanted a career where I would keep learning and developing new skills. However, after spending five years in academia, and three in a more traditional academic setting, I knew in year four that academia wasn't for me. However, I had a full-ride so I decided to finish my degree and explore other options during that time.    


During college I dove into more technical things, and by graduate school I began to think about learning coding more seriously.  While working at as a researcher and web admin for North Korea Leadership Watch over the summer, I reorganized the website and the menus which got me hooked on researching how website coding and design worked. So, I picked up a basic coding textbook, and started some exercises on Code Academy.  
Last summer I looked into applying to Ada, but with a full credit load of graduate school and a part-time job I knew that I wouldn't have the time necessary to fully devote myself. This year, after graduation, I remembered Ada, and upon discovering the new loan program I knew that I had to apply. I spent the month before the application window opened researching and preparing everything I could, finding alumni blogs, previous information sessions, and working through the entire Jumpstart Curriculum. It was those nights of working through Jumpstart that convinced me that Ada was the right fit.
