# Passion for software development, including specifics about what and how.  

If I told you my life story at a glance, software and computers wouldn't be what you would assume that I was interested in. I would spend countless afternoons exploring my parents collection of National Geographic magazines, and as soon as I finished my school work I would ride my bike to library and not come back until dinner, emmersing myself in everything from comic books, to cookbooks and books about martial arts.  
I think the real reason I didn't become interested in developing technolgy until later in life was how my parents resticted our access to technology. We had one family computer which all six of us kids would share, and we could only use it for an hour a day and that only started when we were older, on top of that we didn't have any video games in the house itself. As I got older the restrictions were loosened and by the time I was in high school smartphones were starting to become more wide spread. As cheesy as it sounds, once technology was permeating more and more of our lives I started to develop more and more of an interest. It wasn't until college that I got an iphone and I immediately loved the multi-functional nature of the device. I would look at apps and in my mind be constantly thinking of how I might be able to immprove the functionality of a certain feature or the things, if I only knew how, that I would develop on my own. However, by that point I was already well into my liberal arts degree at a school that didn't really offer any substantial coding opportunities, and at that point I still saw myself pursuing a career in academia. It wasn't until I had a taste of more traditional academia in graduate school that I realized, while I wanted to finish my M.A. academia was not the right place for me. So halfway through my degree I had to decide what I wanted to do, I had a full ride so there wasn't a financial motivation to drop out, and if anything the extra year would give me the opportunity to think more about what I really wanted out of a career. It broke down into two options; work in my field (North Korea), and move somewhere on the East Coast to work in government intelligence, or take the time to learn the technical skills that would give me the daily intellectual challenge and life-long learning that I've always wanted. While, working in the intelligence field does allow you to continue learning things through your career with my specialized background I would be shoehorned into only analyzing that which isn't appealing.  
So about a year ago I started doing research on the more technical skills that I wanted to learn. I bought a C++ textbook and whenever I wasn't studying North Korean nuclear motivations I was trying to learn as much as I could about the very basics programming like terminology, and exercises on Code Academy. I wanted to take coding classes at UW however, as a graduate student I wouldn't get credit for the basic classes that I needed. I even considered applying for Ada but I was already taking over a full load of credits and knew there was no way I could juggle both. After I graduated earlier this summer I decided that coding was something that I wanted to pursue, and while I waited for the application window to open, I worked through the entire Jumpstart curriculum. And it was those nights of working through Jumpstart (before it was updated last week) that convinced me that Ada was the right fit for me.
