### Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?  
During my childhood I had minimal exposure to technology other than a word processing tool. Throughout my life I wanted a career where I could continue learning, and as I got older I thought that academia would be the best fit for me. After spending five years in academia, and three in traditional academia, I knew half way through the fourth year that academia wasn't for me. However, I had a full-ride so I decided to finish and explore other options before leaving.    
During college I dove into more technical things, and by graduate school I began to think about learning coding more seriously.  While working at as a researcher and web admin for North Korea Leadership Watch over the summer, I reorganized the website and the menus which got me hooked on researching how website coding and design worked. So, I picked up a basic coding textbook, and started some exercises on Code Academy.  
Last summer of last year I looked into applying to Ada, but with a full credit load of graduate school and a part-time job I knew that I wouldn't have the time necessary to fully devote myself. This year, after graduation, I remembered Ada, and upon discovering the new loan program I knew that I had to apply. I spent the month before the last application window opened researching and preparing everything I could, finding alumni blogs, previous information sessions, and working through the entire Jumpstart Curriculum.  This time around between the admissions I continued to work through codeacademy tutorials and came up with side projects where I wrote some HTML and CSS code to display a gallery of photos so that I could put things in a more practical settings. It was those nights of working through the tutorials and side projects that convinced me that coding & Ada were the right fit.

### If you're accepted to our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?  
Currently, I would see myself working on mobile app development or front end web development in the future. As of now, I’m more interested in working on front-end development, potentially at an indie studio. I would pursue developing my leadership skills. I want to work within the community to encourage Seattle companies to emphasize diversity, inclusivity, and awareness.

### After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  
When I first started to research Ada, the first thing that caught my eye was the sense of community. During the application process I was touched, not only by how helpful Adies were but also the tech community at large. By asking questions on Stack Overflow I was forced to engage with people that I, frankly, found intimidating; they were friendly and eager to help in anyway they could. Those experiences made me even more detirmined to work hard to become a part of that community.   
I fell in love with Seattle and I want to help however I can to improve how women and minorities (cis, trans, or gender non-conforming) are represented within the tech industry. I would carry Ada’s values into the workplace and promote inclusion and understanding.

### Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?  
Throughout my early education all my teachers would tell me that if I applied myself more my grades would improve greatly. I thought this was a good thing when I was younger; I could do the bare minimum and still get good grades. When I got to high school I deliberately took certain classes because I knew they would be easy. Because I never failed classes and got mostly B’s my parents saw no reason for concern -- they would never force me to do school work and trusted me to get it in on time. My friends had to study more, but developed stronger work ethics as a result.    
I had to develop a work ethic later in college when I found myself taking classes where not every topic interested me. If I was able to have a do over, I would have applied myself in high school and learned the hard lessons of self-discipline, when I had the support of family around me, saving myself a lot of stress and time further down the road.
