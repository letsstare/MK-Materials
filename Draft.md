# Passion for software development, including specifics about what and how.  

If I told you my life story at a glance software and computers wouldn't be what you would assume that I was interested in. However, through out my life there were always hints of interest that came out. I couldn't fully explore these until I entered college, as my parents restricted our exposure to technology. The one thing that I remember being allowed to do most fully was Mavis Beacon's Typing Institute which was my favorite game and I loved seeing all the things that a computer was capable of doing. As a kid I spent a lot of time at my neighbors house where we would play video games almost all day. We would play Soul Calibur, World of Warcraft, and Nancy Drew games, and once again I was in awe as to the things that a computer could do.
