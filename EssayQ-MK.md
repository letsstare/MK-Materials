**Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**  
Technology has been something that I've been interested in throughout my life, however it wasn't until later in high school and college that I really dove into the tech world. Roughly a year and a half ago I started running through the HTML/CSS track on Code Academy. However, as graduate school started I had to put that to the side in favor of focusing on meeting my degree requirements.This summer was when I jumped back into coding full swing. I started working through a **C++ textbook** (*C++ Through Game Programming*), the **Ruby track on Code Academy** as well as finishing the entire **Jumpstart Curriculum**. My real interest in programming started when I worked as a researcher, my boss gave me full control over redesigning his website as many of the menus were overrun with options. I initiated a soft overhall of the [website](https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com "North Korea Leadership Watch"), reducing the dropdown menus and creating list pages where all the [biographies] (https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/leadership-biographies "NKLW Biographies") were complied onto one page instead of each individual biography being on a dropdown. However my lack of technical skills limited the amount of redesign that I could do and while I achieved the minimum product I knew that I could have done more with even a little more capabilites in CSS or HTML. And it was after I left that position that I started to consider pursuing coding. I looked into various programs where I could learn coding, including Ada, however as I was committed to another year of graduate school I was unable to seriously pursue coding, and I wouldn't get credit as a graduate student for the basic coding classes that I wanted to take.
